# HumorBox

Humor Box - a WearOS application designed to deliver a wide range of jokes to brighten your day! Whether you're in need of a general laugh or a witty programming jest, Humor Box has got you covered. It utilizes the [Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api) to fetch jokes from various categories.

**Kindly be aware that this application is currently in an alpha stage. As such, there may be occasional bugs, and new features will be introduced gradually over time.**

## Features

- **Random Jokes**: Get a random joke with just a tap on your WearOS device.
- **Category Selection**: Browse jokes by category, including general, programming, and more.
- **Favorite Jokes**: Mark your favorite jokes to easily access them later (*coming soon*).
